# MachineLearningSamples
Some various scripts/code samples that demonstrate my work in machine and deep learning.

BasicNeuralNetwork.py - Run using an Anaconda Python3 environment or a Python 3 environment with NumPy installed. Neural network with 3 input data sets in the training data and 1 in the testing data set. The network is trained 150000 times to produce an output with described error. Bias sourced in small training data size and unoptimized layer counts.
